The struggle of forgetting the course pack
Gotta take notes in vim

Least Squares Fit
	- Always skewed right
	- F-Statistic
		- Bigger F is better
		- Ratio of explained variation to unexplained variation
	- The degrees of freeedom df are k and n-k-1
	- 2 formulas
		- Standard error of slop
		- Standard error of intercept
	- 2 Hypotheses to test
		- H0:a = 0
		- H1:1 != 0

		- H0:b = 0
		- H1:b != 0
	- They test whether the estimates of intercept a and slope b are 
	  significantly different
	- When there's only 1 slope estimated, ask if the overall fit
	  significant?
	- Assumptions about the random error
		- Errors are normall distributed
		- Errors have constant variance
		- The errors are independent
	- Yield(Purifier) = 13.452 + 4.908 * Purifier
	-
